Tritons Against Modern Slavery is a collective of passionate and academically-driven students at the University of California San Diego. Comprised of both undergraduate and graduate students, we aim to create tangible changes in the trafficking landscape of San Diego, through combined research, innovation and volunteering efforts. 

Founded in 2018 by a UCSD graduate student, Renee Johnson, TAMS was a passion project to protect victims of human trafficking in San Diego. Due to San Diego's steeped environment in human trafficking, UCSD seemed like a good vantage point to ideate how to create change in the San Diego area. We are excited to continue to fight human trafficking in San Diego, and appreciate any support.
