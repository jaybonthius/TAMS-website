title: Sex Trafficking Awareness

---
As it is an often stigmatized concept, sex trafficking could take place in more ways that people normally realize. In fact, according to Polaris, it could be controlled and organized by not just strangers using techniques of coercion and promises of employment, but also romantic partners or family members that force the victims into prostitution. In the meantime, anyone regardless of gender, nationality, age, and other personal characteristics could be the victim of sex trafficking. It is our mission to not only raise awareness in regards to sex trafficking and its horrendous effects on the victims, but also demystify the concept and remove the stigma around it so as to really open up the discourse.
