**Overview**

Tritons Against Modern Slavery (TAMS) was created as an anti-human trafficking research and volunteer-based organization at UCSD. We believe in creating lasting change in San Diego, through volunteering efforts, inciting change through research, as well as the creation of partnerships with local San Diego to promote policy change.

**Current Projects**

We are working to utilize AI technology to aid in potential anti-trafficking efforts. Additionally, we are researching how Amazon can implement more stringent anti-human trafficking efforts with a multi-faceted approach. Email us at tams.ucsd@gmail.com if you are interested in being apart of what we do.
